# Resources

- [Based upon Jonathan Stark's 'How to write better proposals' webinar session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzJX9rHLMNM)
- [Template from Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/dl/5_PAGE_PROJECT_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.pdf)

# What is this about and why should I care
- Would you like to decrease the amount of effort it takes to write project proposals
- Would you like to increase your close rate for your project proposals?
- Would you like to maximize your project fees without impacting your close rates

# Structure of proposals
- Cover Letter
- Situation Appraisal
	- Headlines:
		- Current situation 
		- Desired future state
			- What is a win?
			- Whas is sign of change?
			- Current situation the customer don't like
			- Goal
				- This should include some sort of price anchoring: how much value in â‚¬/$ should be generated
		- Perceived contribution
			- Your contribution to the goal
			- What do YOU think what your contribution is
	- max 1/2 to 3/4 page in total
	- 3 - 4 sentences per headline
	- plain english, don't try to sell
- Project Options
	- Three options
		- Options
			- Option 1: I make a blueprint/roadmap (DIY/THEY do all the work; you contribute the least); e.g. by giving a blueprint or workshop - they build the house. 
			- Option 2: I make a blueprint and are  available for consulting (DONE WITH YOU. THEY do most of the work); e.g. by giving the blueprint and overseeing the project (**not** project management)
			- Option 3: DONE BY YOU; most ownership
	- Incremental, not ala carte (Option 3 is option 1 and 2 and something different)
	- Benefits focused
		- After each option ask "I do these things and **So what?**" and describe the outcome
- Risk & Assumptions
- Why Me?
	- Differentiate from others
- Payment & Terms
	- Fixed prices
	- 100% up-front
		- negotiatable
	- Expiration date
		- 2 weeks, after that you can't guarantee availability
		- Make a calendar entry to get back to the customer after two weeks: "Do you get the proposal?"

## Questions
- Do you charge for the proposal or interview?
	- No, but 1 hour max for the interview.
- How to state a timeline for a project?
	- Timeline is not a deadline
	- We don't know how long it takes
	- Start with the most optimistic
	- No dates, no deadline
	- Just estimates, **no promises**
	- "Don't count on this"
	- **"This is why we don't charge by the hour because we don't know how long it takes"**
- If client requires a timeline, he means usually "deadline" instead of timeline
- Customer thinks, the pricing is too high
	- Your price is higher than the value for your customer -> Why-conversation failed
	- You have a positioning problem b/c no differentiation from other developers
	- You have to be the obvious choice
- If customer only wants one option, he has already self-diagnosed: he wants you to do a specific task. You are the implementer/labor worker, not the consulter/expert
- [What about one-page comparison of your three options?](https://youtu.be/uzJX9rHLMNM?t=6268)
	- Can work, see [The Win Without Pitching Manifesto](https://amzn.to/3cFnLrF)
- Do you have an SLA defined?
	- [Never done before, worked without problems until now](https://youtu.be/uzJX9rHLMNM?t=6532)
- Can I do the proposal as a presentation and not just as sending a document by mail?
	- Yes you can do it, but this has never been needed by Jonathan. PDF has been enough.
	- But the presentation is **not** a selling pitch!
- How do you handle a client who does not know what he wants (e.g. idea for a software application)
	- Three different options for discovery sessions
	- Or discovery session as a productized service for a fixed price

# Conducting a sales interview
## General considerations
- It's an interview, not a pitch
	- You don't know if you are the best option!
	- Ask questions, let them keep talking
	- Keep the client talking 80-90% of the time 
	- You are the doctor
		- Tell me where it hurts?
		- How long does it happening?
	- Questions
		- What is your desired feature state?
	- Be genuinely willing to walk away
	- Never try to persuade or convince
		- If you have to convince, you already have lost the client -> Differentiation from other offers is missing
 	- Gain confidence you can help them
	- Clarity
		- [Don't use buzzwords, use clarity in your language](https://youtu.be/uzJX9rHLMNM?t=5114)
		- Clarity is critical


- Try to talk them out of hiring you
	- "Do you want that job?" - "Yes, I want to make sure it fits." - A good client will appreciate that
	- Why-conversation
		- Why this?
			- Why do this project?
			- Why do not to do this project?
		- Why now?
			- Has anything changed?
			- Why not in six months?
			- Why not before six months?
		- Why me?
			- Don't you have internal developers?
			- Why don't hire five developres?
			- Fiver?
			- What about other cheaper options?


## Determine what the success metric is
- What does a home run look like here?
	- How to make sure the symptom is gone
- What would be a disasterous outcome?
- What will the primary stakeholder user to judge the success or failure?
	- Probably reschedule the meeting with the primary stakeholder if not your talking partner

### Questions
- What if customer does not name a budget?
	- The budget is not so relevant, it could be wrong. The customer does not know the budget b/c he has self-diagnosed.
	- Don't take the money if the budget is not needed for spending; say, that you don't know why you should be hired
	- A budget indicates a self-diagnosis
	- "What is in it for you [the customer]?"
	- Always show that you are the expensive option to filter out clients without budget

- What if you are one of multiple vendors/service providers?
	- Positioning is the problem

# Pricing
## General Considerations
- Scope last
	- Don't talk about the scope in the interview!
	- Start with the value
	- Pick some prices
	- For option 3: What can I do to reach a homerun?

- Pricing curves
	- For the three options in the proposal
		- either 1, 2.2x, 5x (10k, 22k, 50k), Goldilock
		- or 10k, 15k, 17.5k if you don't want to leave money on the table
		- or something completely customized (unusual)

- Justifying your prices
	- "How did you calculate these prices?"
		- Based on experience: Clients like this, projects like this
	- "How many hours do you think this will take?"
		- I don't know. This is why I give you a fixed price
	- "You're twice as expensive as anyone else! Why should we go with you?"
		- "Have you talked to other people and do they stand behind their prices and they commit and won't exceed? If yes, go with them."
		- Maybe a positioning issue. It goes away with more experience in the market.

## Questions
- How do you handle risk factors and assumptions?
	- Put them in the proposal
	- In the initial kickoff meeting after having been hired: check and review the risks and assumptions. 
		- If it is completely disconnected: give the money back b/c of the risk.
		- Already factor it into the pricing; this justifies the high price
	- **Whoever is taking the risk gets the money**; Business owner knows this. They are willed to pay for it.
- Client wants to know the price during the interview: How expensive are you?
	- "I don't know"; "I don't have a hourly rate"
	- The hourly rate is completely useless if they don't know the total amount of required time
	- How do you know how the price is?
		- "I give you one"
		- "Something between 500 or 5 Million"

- Pyramid
	- First level (lowest, worst paid): maintenance
	- Second level: implementation
	- Third level (highest, best paid): strategy
